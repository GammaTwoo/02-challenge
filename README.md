# Gavin, the Developer (Portfolio)

This is a website I created to show off my projects as a learning developer. More projects will be added as I complete them.

## Usage

The buttons in the nav bar at the top each bring you to their corresponding section. The Linkedin and Github buttons in the "About Me" section bring you to my Linkedin and Github pages, respectively. All of the cards in the "projects" section are links to their corresponding website, each deployed separately. The links in the contact me section bring you to your devices default app for said link (calling app for the number, email app for the gmail)
